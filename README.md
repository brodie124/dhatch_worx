To merge a website to the new version of the worx theme, first back up the existing worx theme stored on the server (both the worx and worx child).

After doing so, delete the existing worx folder (not the child) and then upload the new worx theme. If you have made any changes to the core theme, you will have to add them back yourself(use the backup to get the code).

If in the worx child you have made any changes (such as a change to footer.php or header.php) then delete it, copy the file(such as footer.php) from the worx directory to the worx child directory and re-add the code - once again using the backup.
